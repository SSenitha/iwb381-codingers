## _Letter Tracking System_
This project is a letter-tracking system designed to streamline letter management in offices across Sri Lanka.
 
In many office environments, many letters circulate daily, making it difficult to track their progress and increasing the risk of losing important documents. This system assigns each letter a unique identification number, allowing employees to process and forward letters using the letter ID and the recipient's employee ID.

Users can track their letters through the system and receive notifications when they are processed and ready for collection, ensuring better efficiency and accountability.
